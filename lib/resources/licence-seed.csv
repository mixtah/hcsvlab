In this clause 4C, ""moral rights"" means the personal rights granted by law to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example, Part IX of the <em>Copyright Act 1968</em> (Cth) grants authors the right of integrity of authorship, the right of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have authorship falsely attributed.</p> <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p> <ol type=""a""> <li> Except as expressly stated in this Licence or otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor offers the Work ""as-is"" and makes no representations, warranties or conditions of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise.

Termination</strong></p> <p>This Licence and the rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of the Licence. Individuals or entities who have received a Collection from You pursuant to this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided they remain in full compliance with those licences. Clauses 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive any termination of this Licence.</p> <p><strong>8. Licensor&rsquo;s Rights Retained</strong></p> <p>Subject to the above terms, the Licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding this, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time. However, any such release will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.</p> <p><strong>9. Licence Grant to Recipients of the Work from You</strong></p> <p>Each time You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or a Collection the Licensor offers the recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms as are granted to You under this Licence.</p> <p><strong>10.

Waivers and Consents</strong></p> <p>No term of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the relevant party.</p> <p><strong>12. Entire Agreement</strong></p> <p>This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. To the full extent permitted by law, there are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.

For example, a translation could be marked ""The original work was translated from English to Spanish"".</li> <li>In the case of a Derivative Work or Collection, the above attribution should, at a minimum, appear as part of any credits for other contributing authors and be as prominent as the credits for those other authors.</li> <li>You must, to the extent practicable, remove the above attribution from any Collection or Derivative Work if requested to do so by the Licensor or Original Author.</li> <li> For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this clause 4D for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above. By exercising Your rights under this Licence, You must not assert or imply:  <ol type=""i""> <li>any connection between the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party and You or Your use of the Work; or</li> <li>sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party of You or Your use of the Work,</li> </ol> without their separate, express prior written permission. </li> </ol> <p><strong><em>4E Moral Rights</em></strong></p> <p>Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and nonwaivable at law.

  Terms of Use for the AusTalk Corpus
</p> <br/> <p>
  The AusTalk corpus has been collected by a consortium of Universities under the Big ASC project, funded by the ARC,
  and it is intended to be made broadly available for research on Australian speech and language. Unfortunately the
  terms under which we can release the data more widely are still under negotiation with our legal advisors. Members
  of the University partners that collected the data are free to use the data, as this was part of the Big ASC project
  agreement, and there are no restrictions on the use of the data as long as it is for research. However, you must not
  share or further distribute any data from the AusTalk corpus outside of the Big ASC project partners. This includes
  the demographic descriptions of participants (meta-data) as well as the audio and video recordings themselves.
</p> <br/> <p>
  It is a condition of use that any annotation or transcription that is done with the AusTalk corpus data should be
  contributed back to the project for use by others. Any such contribution will be stored in a way that identifies you
  as the creator.
