Feature: Administer users
  In order to allow users to access the system
  As an administrator
  I want to administer users

  Background:
    Given I have users
      | email                       | first_name | last_name |
      | raul@alveo.edu.au       | Raul       | Carrizo   |
      | georgina@alveo.edu.au   | Georgina   | Edwards   |
      | data_owner@alveo.edu.au | Data       | Owner     |
    And I have the usual roles and permissions
    And "georgina@alveo.edu.au" has role "admin"
    And "data_owner@alveo.edu.au" has role "data owner"

  Scenario: Count of total researcher visits and weekly frequency is shown on user list page
    And I am logged in as "georgina@alveo.edu.au"
    Given I have users
      | email                        | first_name | last_name |
      | researcher1@alveo.edu.au | Researcher | One       |
      | researcher2@alveo.edu.au | Researcher | Two       |
    And "researcher1@alveo.edu.au" has role "researcher"
    And "researcher2@alveo.edu.au" has role "researcher"
    And "researcher1@alveo.edu.au" has the following past sessions
      | sign_in_time | duration_in_minutes |
      | 3_DAYS_AGO   | 10                  |
      | 4_DAYS_AGO   | 30                  |
      | 8_DAYS_AGO   | 60                  |

      | 15_DAYS_AGO  | 40                  |
      | 16_DAYS_AGO  | 20                  |
    And "researcher2@alveo.edu.au" has the following past sessions

      | 5_DAYS_AGO   | 120                 |
      | 6_DAYS_AGO   | 60                  |
    And I am on the list users page
    Then I should see "Total number of visits by users with role 'researcher' in the last week is 7."
    And I should see "Total duration of use by users with role 'researcher' in the last week is 4.83 hours"
    And I should see "Average frequency of use per week by users with role 'researcher' is 3.67 total number of visits."
    And I should see "Average duration of use per week by users with role 'researcher' is 2.31 hours per user"

  Scenario: Counts when there are no researchers/visits is shown on the user list page
    And I am logged in as "georgina@alveo.edu.au"
    Given I am on the list users page
    Then I should see "There are 0 registered users with role 'researcher'."
    And I should see "Total number of visits by users with role 'researcher' in the last week is 0."
    And I should see "Total duration of use by users with role 'researcher' in the last week is 0 hours"
    And I should see "Average frequency of use per week by users with role 'researcher' is 0 total number of visits."
    And I should see "Average duration of use per week by users with role 'researcher' is 0 hours per user"
