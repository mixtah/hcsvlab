Feature: Accessing, assigning licences via API
  As a Data Owner,
  I want to use the API to get and assign licences to collections

  Background:
    Given I have the usual roles and permissions
    And I have users
      | email                        | first_name | last_name |
      | admin@alveo.edu.au       | Admin      | One       |
      | researcher1@alveo.edu.au | Researcher | One       |
      | data_owner@alveo.edu.au  | Data_Owner | One       |
    And "admin@alveo.edu.au" has role "admin"
    And "admin@alveo.edu.au" has an api token
    And "data_owner@alveo.edu.au" has role "data owner"
    And "data_owner@alveo.edu.au" has an api token
    And "researcher1@alveo.edu.au" has role "researcher"
    And "researcher1@alveo.edu.au" has an api token

  Scenario: Researcher can't access licences
    Given I make a JSON request for the licences page with the API token for "researcher1@alveo.edu.au"
    Then I should get a 403 response code
    And the JSON response should be:
    """
    {"error":"You are not authorised to access this page."}
    """

  Scenario Outline: Data Owners and Admins can access licences via API
    Given I make a JSON request for the licences page with the API token for "<user>"
    Then I should get a 200 response code
  Examples:
    | user                        |
    | data_owner@alveo.edu.au |
    | admin@alveo.edu.au      |

  Scenario: No licences
    Given I make a JSON request for the licences page with the API token for "data_owner@alveo.edu.au"
    Then I should get a 200 response code
    And the JSON response should be:
    """
    []
    """

  Scenario: Get licences via API
    Given I have licence "Creative Commons" with id 100
    And I have licence "AusNC Terms of Use" with id 101
    And I make a JSON request for the licences page with the API token for "admin@alveo.edu.au"
    Then I should get a 200 response code
    And the JSON response should be:
    """
    [{"name":"Creative Commons","id":100},{"name":"AusNC Terms of Use","id":101}]
    """

  Scenario: Assigning an invalid licence in collection creation
    Given I make a JSON post request for the collections page with the API token for "data_owner@alveo.edu.au" with JSON params
      | name | collection_metadata | licence_id |
      | Test | {"@context": "http://example.org/schema/json-ld", "alveo:metadata": {"@id": "http://collection.test", "@type": "dcmitype:Collection", "dc:creator": "Pam Peters", "dc:rights": "All rights reserved to Data Owner", "dc:subject": "English Language", "dc:title": "A test collection", "marcrel:OWN": "Data Owner"}} | 5 |
    Then I should get a 400 response code
    And the JSON response should be:
    """
    {"error":"Licence with id 5 does not exist"}
    """

  Scenario: Assigning a licence in collection creation
    Given I have licence "Creative Commons" with id 8
    And I make a JSON post request for the collections page with the API token for "data_owner@alveo.edu.au" with JSON params
      | name | collection_metadata | licence_id |
      | Test | {"@context": "http://example.org/schema/json-ld", "alveo:metadata": {"@id": "http://collection.test", "@type": "dcmitype:Collection", "dc:creator": "Pam Peters", "dc:rights": "All rights reserved to Data Owner", "dc:subject": "English Language", "dc:title": "A test collection", "marcrel:OWN": "Data Owner"}} | 8 |
    Then I should get a 200 response code
    And collection "test" should have licence "Creative Commons"
