Feature: Creating Documents
  As a Data Owner or Admin,
  I want to add a document to an existing item via the web app

  Background:
    Given I have the usual roles and permissions
    And I have a user "admin@alveo.edu.au" with role "admin"
    And I have a user "data_owner@alveo.edu.au" with role "data owner"
    And "data_owner@alveo.edu.au" has an api token
    And I have a user "researcher@alveo.edu.au" with role "researcher"
    And I have languages
      | code  | name      |
      | eng   | English   |
      | zza   | Zaza      |
      | xyj   | Mayi-Yapi |

  Scenario: Verify add document button is visible for collection owner
    Given I ingest "cooee:1-001"
    And Collections ownership is
      | collection | owner_email                 |
      | cooee      | data_owner@alveo.edu.au |
    And I am logged in as "data_owner@alveo.edu.au"
    When I am on the catalog page for "cooee:1-001"
    Then I should see link "Add New Document" to "/add-document/cooee/1-001"

  Scenario Outline: Verify add document button is not visible for users other than the collection owner
    Given I ingest "cooee:1-001"
    And Collections ownership is
      | collection | owner_email                 |
      | cooee      | data_owner@alveo.edu.au |
    And I am logged in as "<user>"
    When I am on the catalog page for "cooee:1-001"
    Then I should not see link "Add New Item" to "/add-document/cooee/1-001"
  Examples:
    | user |
    | admin@alveo.edu.au      |
    | researcher@alveo.edu.au |

  Scenario: Verify add document button goes to new document form page and shows item name
    Given I ingest "cooee:1-001"
    And Collections ownership is
      | collection | owner_email                 |
      | cooee      | data_owner@alveo.edu.au |
    And I am logged in as "data_owner@alveo.edu.au"
    When I am on the catalog page for "cooee:1-001"
    When I follow element with id "add_new_document"
    Then I should be on the add document page for "cooee:1-001"
    And I should see "Add Document to '1-001'"

  Scenario Outline: Verify users other than the collection owner are not authorised to load add document page
    Given I ingest "cooee:1-001"
    And Collections ownership is
      | collection | owner_email                 |
      | cooee      | data_owner@alveo.edu.au |
    And I am logged in as "<user>"
    When I am on the add document page for "cooee:1-001"
    Then I should see "You are not authorised to access this page."
  Examples:
    | user |
    | admin@alveo.edu.au      |
    | researcher@alveo.edu.au |

  Scenario: Verify add document page has expected form fields
    Given I ingest "cooee:1-001"

      | collection | owner_email                 |
      | cooee      | data_owner@alveo.edu.au |
    And I am logged in as "data_owner@alveo.edu.au"
    When I am on the add document page for "cooee:1-001"
    Then I should see "Add Document"
    And I should see "Please select a file:"
    And I should see "Document Metadata"
    And I should see "Language: "
    And I should see "Additional Metadata"
    And I should see "See the RDF Names of searchable fields for examples of accepted metadata field names."
    And I should see link "searchable fields" to "/catalog/searchable_fields"
    And I should see "Note: If the context for a field you want to enter is not available in the default schema then you must provide the full URI for that metadata field."
    And I should see link "default schema" to "/schema/json-ld"
    And I should see "Add Metadata Field"
    And I should see button with text "Add Metadata Field"
    And I should see link "Cancel" to "/catalog/cooee/1-001"
    And I should see button "Create"

  Scenario: Verify add metadata name/value fields not visible by default
